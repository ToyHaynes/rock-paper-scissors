# rock-paper-scissors

#Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. The game allows players to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and determines the winner based on the choices made.

#Features
Basic game logic: The game follows the standard rules of Rock Paper Scissors, where rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beat paper.
User interface (UI): The game includes a simple user interface that allows players to make their choices and displays the game results.
Easy to play: Players can easily understand and participate in the game with just a few clicks.
#Future Improvements
I plan to continue improving the game by adding more features and enhancing the user experience. Some of the improvements I have in mind include:

Enhanced UI: I aim to create a more visually appealing user interface with better graphics and design elements.
Animation: I intend to incorporate animations to make the game more engaging and interactive.
Score tracking: I will implement a score system to keep track of the number of wins, losses, and ties for each player.
Multiplayer mode: I plan to add a multiplayer mode so that players can compete against their friends or other online players.
Difficulty levels: I want to introduce different difficulty levels for the computer opponent, allowing players to challenge themselves with smarter AI opponents.
